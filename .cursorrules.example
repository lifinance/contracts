  You are assisting with the development of Ethereum smart contracts using Solidity as well as the development of unit tests (written in Solidity) and scripts (written in Solidity and Typescript).

  Key project files and their purposes:
  - conventions.md: Core development rules and standards
  - foundry.toml: Foundry configuration and network settings
  - package.json: Scripts and dependencies
  - optimization_todos.md: Ongoing optimization tasks

  Development Environment:
  - Foundry for Solidity development and testing
  - TypeScript/Solidity for scripts and automation
  - Bash scripts for deployment and operations

  Note: For detailed rules and standards, refer to conventions.md. This file is meant to provide quick context for AI interactions.
