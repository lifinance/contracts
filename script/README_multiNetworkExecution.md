# Multi Network Execution System

This document explains how to use the complete network execution system in `multiNetworkExecution.sh`, which includes all network iteration functionality, automatic grouping, and progress tracking.

## Overview

The `multiNetworkExecution.sh` file contains the complete network execution system, including:

- **Original Functions**: `iterateAllNetworks()`, `handleNetwork()`, `generateSummary()`, etc.
- **New Grouping Functions**: Automatic network grouping by EVM version and zkEVM status
- **Progress Tracking**: Resumable execution with detailed progress tracking
- **Foundry Management**: Automatic `foundry.toml` updates for different compilation requirements

The system automatically groups networks by their EVM version and zkEVM status, then executes them in the correct order:

1. **Group 1: Cancun EVM** (solc 0.8.29) - Networks like blast, hyperevm, berachain (executed first)
2. **Group 2: zkEVM Networks** (use profile.zksync) - Networks like zksync, polygonzkevm
3. **Group 3: London EVM** (solc 0.8.17) - Networks like mainnet, arbitrum, base

**Important Note**: The solc version used for compilation is determined by the EVM version, not by the `deployedWithSolcVersion` field in `networks.json`. The `deployedWithSolcVersion` field reflects the version that was used when the network was originally deployed, but for our grouping purposes, we use the appropriate solc version for each EVM version:

- Cancun EVM networks â†’ solc 0.8.29 (executed first)
- London EVM networks â†’ solc 0.8.17
- zkEVM networks â†’ use existing profile.zksync (NO foundry.toml updates at all)
  - The `[profile.zksync]` section in foundry.toml is never modified
  - Deploy scripts automatically use the zksync profile for zkEVM networks
  - zkEVM networks always execute sequentially for proper resource management

## Key Features

- **Automatic Grouping**: Networks are automatically categorized based on their configuration in `networks.json`
- **Sequential Group Execution**: Groups are executed one after another (cannot run in parallel due to different foundry.toml settings)
- **Parallel Network Execution**: Within each group, networks can run in parallel
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracks which networks succeeded, failed, or are still pending
- **Resumable Execution**: Simply run the same command again to retry only failed networks
- **Foundry.toml Management**: Automatically updates and restores foundry.toml for each group
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging with timestamps and error reporting

## Configuration

The system is configured at the top of `multiNetworkExecution.sh` in three main sections:

### 1. Execution Configuration (Lines 27-37)

Configure execution behavior:

```bash
# PARALLEL EXECUTION SETTINGS
# Set to true to run networks in parallel within each group, false for sequential execution
RUN_PARALLEL=true

# zkEVM networks always run sequentially (regardless of RUN_PARALLEL setting)
# This is because zkEVM networks require special handling in deploy scripts
ZKEVM_ALWAYS_SEQUENTIAL=true
```

### 2. Network Selection Configuration (Lines 39-55)

Choose which networks to execute:

```bash
# Option 1: Use all included networks (default)
NETWORKS=($(getIncludedNetworksArray))

# Option 2: Use specific networks
# NETWORKS=("mainnet" "arbitrum" "base" "zksync" "blast" "hyperevm")

# Option 3: Use networks by EVM version
# NETWORKS=($(getIncludedNetworksByEvmVersionArray "london"))
```

### 3. Network Action Configuration (Lines 57-82)

Choose what actions to execute per network:

```bash
# DEPLOY - Deploy the contract to the network
# deployContract "$NETWORK" "$ENVIRONMENT" "$CONTRACT"

# VERIFY - Verify the contract on the network
# getContractVerified "$NETWORK" "$ENVIRONMENT" "$CONTRACT"

# PROPOSE - Create multisig proposal for the contract
# createMultisigProposalForContract "$NETWORK" "$ENVIRONMENT" "$CONTRACT" "$LOG_DIR"
```

### How Error Tracking Works:

1. **Simple Approach**: The function returns the exit code of the last executed command
2. **Network Status**:
   - `0` = Last action succeeded
   - `1` = Last action failed
3. **Progress Tracking**: Failed networks are tracked in the progress file and can be retried
4. **Retry Logic**: Simply run the same command again to retry only failed networks

**Note**: If you need more sophisticated error handling (e.g., continue on some failures), you can add custom logic in the `executeNetworkActions` function.

## Usage Examples

### 1. Drop-in Replacement for iterateAllNetworks (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# In playground.sh, replace this:
# iterateAllNetworks "$CONTRACT" "$ENVIRONMENT"

# With this:
iterateAllNetworksGrouped "$CONTRACT" "$ENVIRONMENT"
```

**To configure which networks to execute:**
Edit the `NETWORKS` array in the **NETWORK SELECTION CONFIGURATION** section at the top of `multiNetworkExecution.sh` (around line 35).

**To configure what actions to execute per network:**
Edit the **NETWORK ACTION CONFIGURATION** section at the top of `multiNetworkExecution.sh` (around line 56). Uncomment the actions you want to execute.

This is the **easiest way** to use the new system. It:

- Uses your existing `handleNetwork` function
- Automatically groups networks by EVM version
- Handles foundry.toml updates and recompilation
- Provides progress tracking and resumable execution
- Maintains the same interface as your existing code

### 2. Execute Specific Networks with Automatic Grouping

```bash
# In playground.sh, uncomment and modify:
local NETWORKS=("mainnet" "arbitrum" "base" "zksync" "blast" "hyperevm")
executeNetworksByGroup "$CONTRACT" "$ENVIRONMENT" "${NETWORKS[@]}"
```

### 3. Execute All Networks for a Contract

```bash
executeAllNetworksForContract "$CONTRACT" "$ENVIRONMENT"
```

### 4. Execute Only Networks with Specific EVM Version

```bash
# Execute only London EVM networks
executeNetworksByEvmVersion "$CONTRACT" "$ENVIRONMENT" "london"

# Execute only Cancun EVM networks
executeNetworksByEvmVersion "$CONTRACT" "$ENVIRONMENT" "cancun"
```

### 5. Retry Failed Networks

```bash
# Simply run the same command again!
# The system automatically handles retries by resuming from existing progress
iterateAllNetworksGrouped "$CONTRACT" "$ENVIRONMENT"
```

### 6. Get Network Grouping Information

```bash
local NETWORKS=("mainnet" "arbitrum" "base" "zksync" "blast" "hyperevm")
groupNetworksByExecutionGroup "${NETWORKS[@]}"
```

## How It Works

### 1. Network Grouping

The system reads `networks.json` to determine:

- `isZkEVM`: true/false (determines if it's a zkEVM network)
- `deployedWithEvmVersion`: "london" or "cancun" (determines the compilation group)

**Note**: The `deployedWithSolcVersion` field is not used for grouping. Instead, the system uses the appropriate solc version for each EVM version:

- London EVM â†’ solc 0.8.17
- Cancun EVM â†’ solc 0.8.29
- zkEVM networks â†’ solc 0.8.17 (with zksolc compiler)

### 2. Execution Flow

1. **Backup foundry.toml** to preserve current settings
2. **Group 1 (Cancun)**: Update foundry.toml â†’ Recompile â†’ Execute networks in parallel
3. **Group 2 (zkEVM)**: Update foundry.toml â†’ Recompile â†’ Execute networks in parallel (zkEVM compilation handled by deploy scripts)
4. **Group 3 (London)**: Update foundry.toml â†’ Recompile â†’ Execute networks in parallel
5. **Restore foundry.toml** to original settings
6. **Show summary** of results

### 3. Progress Tracking

- Creates `.network_execution_progress.json` to track progress
- Each network has status: `pending`, `in_progress`, `success`, or `failed`
- Failed networks can be retried without redoing successful ones
- Progress file is cleaned up on successful completion

### 4. Error Handling

- Retry logic for individual network failures
- Graceful handling of interrupts (Ctrl+C)
- Detailed error messages and logging
- Automatic cleanup on exit

## Configuration

### Networks.json Requirements

Each network must have these properties:

```json
{
  "network_name": {
    "isZkEVM": false,
    "deployedWithEvmVersion": "london"
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `deployedWithSolcVersion` field is optional and not used for grouping. The system will use the appropriate solc version based on the EVM version:

- `"deployedWithEvmVersion": "london"` â†’ uses solc 0.8.17
- `"deployedWithEvmVersion": "cancun"` â†’ uses solc 0.8.29
- `"isZkEVM": true` â†’ uses solc 0.8.17 with zksolc compiler

### Foundry.toml Profiles

The system expects these profiles in `foundry.toml`:

- `[profile.default]` - Used for London and Cancun networks
- `[profile.zksync]` - Used for zkEVM networks

## Integration with Existing Code

The new system integrates with existing functions:

- Uses `handleNetwork()` from the original `iterateAllNetworks()` function
- Compatible with existing deployment and verification functions
- Maintains the same logging and error handling patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Network not found in networks.json"**

   - Ensure the network name matches exactly what's in `networks.json`
   - Check that the network has the required properties

2. **"Failed to update foundry.toml"**

   - Ensure you have write permissions to `foundry.toml`
   - Check that the file exists and is not corrupted

3. **"Failed to compile contracts"**

   - Ensure the foundry.toml is valid and has the correct solc version
   - Check that all dependencies are properly installed

4. **"Progress tracking file not found"**
   - This happens when trying to retry without a previous execution
   - Run the full execution first, then retry if needed

### Recovery

If execution is interrupted or has failures:

1. The progress file `.network_execution_progress.json` will remain
2. **Simply run the same command again** to resume from where it left off
3. Only pending and failed networks will be retried
4. Successful networks will be skipped automatically
5. No need for special retry functions - just use the same command!

## Complete System Migration

All network execution functionality is now consolidated in `multiNetworkExecution.sh`:

### **What's Included:**

1. **Original Functions** (moved from `playground.sh`):

   - `iterateAllNetworks()` - Original network iteration function
   - `handleNetwork()` - Your custom network handling logic
   - `generateSummary()` - Execution summary generation
   - `cleanupStaleLocks()` - Lock file cleanup

2. **New Grouping Functions**:
   - `iterateAllNetworksGrouped()` - Drop-in replacement with automatic grouping
   - `executeNetworksByGroup()` - Execute specific network groups
   - `groupNetworksByExecutionGroup()` - Group networks by EVM version
   - Progress tracking and resumable execution

### **Migration Steps:**

1. **Source the helpers file** in your script:

   ```bash
   source script/multiNetworkExecution.sh
   ```

2. **Replace function calls**:

   ```bash
   # Old way (still works)
   iterateAllNetworks "$CONTRACT" "$ENVIRONMENT"

   # New way (with automatic grouping)
   iterateAllNetworksGrouped "$CONTRACT" "$ENVIRONMENT"
   ```

3. **Keep your existing `handleNetwork` function** - it will be used automatically

4. **Enjoy the benefits**:
   - Automatic grouping by EVM version
   - Proper foundry.toml management
   - Progress tracking and resumable execution
   - Better error handling and logging
   - All functionality in one shareable file
