name: Olympix Mutation Testing

# - runs the olympix mutation testing on all solidity contracts inside the src/ folder
# - evaluates test suite quality by introducing code mutations and checking if tests catch them
# - always scans all solidity files in src/ to maintain consistent GitHub Code Scanning state
# - uploads mutation testing results to github code scanning for review and discussion within the PR
