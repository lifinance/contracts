# Protect Audit Labels
# - Makes sure that the following labels can only be assigned by a GitHub Action: "AuditCompleted", "AuditRequired", and "AuditNotRequired"
# - Will undo any unauthorized change of these labels
# - Will fail if it runs into an error, otherwise pass
# - Will skip checks if the PR was just approved or set from draft to "ready for review" state
