name: Security Alerts Review

# - ensures that all security alerts from olympix static analysis are properly handled before merging
# - enforces a strict review policy where every alert must be either resolved or dismissed with a justification
# - prevents merging a PR if any alerts are unresolved or dismissed without a comment
# - helps maintain a transparent and collaborative security review process by generating a pr comment summarizing the status of all security alerts
# - automatically reverts the PR to draft status if blocking alerts exist
# - leaves a summary of all alerts in a comment starting with "ü§ñ GitHub Action: Security Alerts Review üîç"
