name: Audit Verifier
# - checks if an audit is required and assigns a (protected) label based on the result ('AuditRequired' or 'AuditNotRequired')
# - if an audit is required, it will verify that the audit was actually completed and then assign label "AuditCompleted"
# - verification includes:
#   - ensuring the audit log contains an entry for all added/modified contracts in their latest version
#   - ensuring that an audit report has been added
#   - ensuring that the PR is approved by the auditor (uses auditor git handle from audit log)
#   - ensuring that the commit hash that was audited is actually part of this PR
# - if "AuditCompleted" was assigned earlier but conditions are not met anymore due to changes submitted after the check, label "AuditCompleted" will be removed by this action

# KNOWN LIMITATIONS
# - will only check the last 100 commits for any matches with audit commit hashes
# - only one audit can be registered per contract (in a specific version)
