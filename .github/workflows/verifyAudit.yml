# Audit Verifier
# - checks if an audit is required for a given PR
#   - an audit is required if any .sol file in path 'src/' has been modified or added
# - if audit is required, the action will assign the label "AuditRequired", otherwise it will assign label "AuditNotRequired"
# - it will also make sure that at the end, exactly one of these two labels is indeed assigned

name: Audit Verifier
# - checks if an audit is required and assigns a (protected) label based on the result ('AuditRequired' or 'AuditNotRequired')
# - if an audit is required, it will verify that the audit was actually done and assign label "AuditCompleted"
# - verification includes:
#   - ensuring the audit log contains an entry for all added/modified contracts in their latest version
#   - ensuring that an audit report has been added
#   - ensuring that the PR is approved by the auditor (uses auditor git handle from audit log)
#   - ensuring that the commit hash that was audited is actually part of this PR

# KNOWN LIMITATIONS
# - will only check the last 100 commits for any matches with audit commit hashes
