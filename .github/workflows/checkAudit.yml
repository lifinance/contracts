# - Github Audit Checker
# - checks if an audit is required
#   YES, if:
#   > contract in src/*.sol (no test or script contracts)
# - checks if an audit was conducted
#   > is there at least one complete entry in the audit log for that contract/version
# - checks if all audit-related files are updated accordingly
#   > is the audit report uploaded to ./audit/reports/ ?
# - checks if there is one approving review of an auditor (do we really want this?)
