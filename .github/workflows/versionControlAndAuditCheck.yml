  # - Watches changes on version-controlled contracts and makes sure that versions are bumped in case of relevant changes:
  # - Relevant changes == anything except for changes of license identifier, solidity pragma of pure comment changes
  # - watched paths: src/*
  # - will check all modified or new contracts in watched paths
  # - will fail if a new contract was added to watched paths without contract version
  # - will fail if an existing contract was modified but version was not updated
  # - will update the PR title to contain all contract names and their new versions (watched paths only)

  # Audit Verifier
  # - checks if an audit is required and assigns a (protected) label based on the result ('AuditRequired' or 'AuditNotRequired')
  # - if an audit is required, it will verify that the audit was actually completed and then assign label "AuditCompleted"
  # - verification includes:
  #   - ensuring the audit log contains an entry for all added/modified contracts in their latest version
  #   - ensuring that an audit report has been added
  #   - ensuring that the PR is approved by the auditor (uses auditor git handle from audit log)
  #   - ensuring that the commit hash that was audited is actually part of this PR
  # - if "AuditCompleted" was assigned earlier but conditions are not met anymore due to changes submitted after the check, label "AuditCompleted" will be removed by this action

  # KNOWN LIMITATIONS
  # - will only check the last 100 commits for any matches with audit commit hashes
  # - only one audit can be registered per contract (in a specific version)
