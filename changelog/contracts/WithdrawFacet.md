### 🔄 Changed

- `WithdrawFacet`: Updated contract version from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 in both @custom:version tag and getWithdrawFacetVersion() return value
- **Note**: This is a version-only update with no code logic changes. The version bump likely indicates deployment or documentation synchronization. No redeployment required unless coordinating with other facet updates in the diamond pattern.
