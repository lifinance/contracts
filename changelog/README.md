# Contract Changelogs

This directory contains individual changelog files for each commit that modifies Solidity contracts.

## File Structure

Each changelog file is named after the full commit hash: `{commitHash}.md`

Example: `changelog/8bbf470b470523eb582843deca6dbba755497e84.md`

## Format

Each changelog file contains:

- **Commit information**: Full commit hash, date, author, and link to GitHub commit
- **Change categories**:
  - ⚠️ Breaking Changes
  - ✨ Added
  - 🔄 Changed
  - 🗑️ Removed
  - 🐛 Fixed

## Generation

Changelogs are automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow when:

- A PR is merged to `main` that modifies files in `src/**/*.sol`
- A push is made to the test branch `SMAR-41-Research-how-we-can-auto-generate-contract-changelogs-using-AI`
- Manual execution via `workflow_dispatch`

The changelog generation uses AI-powered analysis (CodeRabbit API by default) to provide semantic descriptions of contract changes.
