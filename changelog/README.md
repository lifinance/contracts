# Contract Changelogs

This directory holds auto-generated changelogs for Solidity contract changes.

## File structure

- **`CHANGELOG.md`** – All contract changes grouped by **version** (from `@custom:version`). One block per run; inside it, one subsection per contract version.
- **`contracts/{ContractName}.md`** – Per-contract history with one section per **version** (e.g. `## v1.0.2`).

## Format

- Entries are grouped by **contract version**, not by commit. Multiple commits in a PR that touch the same version are merged into one section.
- Each version section includes: **Commits** (links), **Date**, and categories: ⚠️ Breaking Changes, ✨ Added, 🔄 Changed, 🗑️ Removed, 🐛 Fixed.
- Author is not included.

## When changelogs are generated

Changelogs are generated by the **GitHub Actions workflow** when:

- **Push to any branch** that modifies files under `src/**/*.sol`
- **Manual run** via Actions tab → `generateContractChangelog` → Run workflow

Only **real code changes** trigger generation; comment-only diffs are skipped.
