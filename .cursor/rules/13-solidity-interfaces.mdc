description: Interface-only rules for Solidity interfaces in src/Interfaces
globs:
  - 'src/Interfaces/**/*.sol'
---

- Interfaces must be Solidity `.sol` files located in `src/Interfaces/`; do not place interfaces elsewhere.
- Header: `SPDX-License-Identifier: LGPL-3.0-only` on the first line and `pragma solidity ^0.8.17;` immediately after; include a concise NatSpec header with `@title`, `@author`, and `@custom:version`.
- Interface naming: use the `I*` prefix for all interfaces (e.g. `ILiFi`, `IGlacisAirlift`).
- Parameter naming: follow [CONV:NAMING]; use descriptive, lowerCamelCase names that match the upstream protocol where practical, but prefer local clarity over blindly mirroring odd upstream names.
- Upstream references: when copying from or shadowing an external protocol, add a short NatSpec note with a link or identifier that references the original contract or documentation.
- Scope: only include the structs/events/functions that are actually used by our code; avoid copying the entire upstream interface surface if it is not needed.
