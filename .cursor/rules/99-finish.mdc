- **Conventions**: Verify `[CONV:LICENSE]`/`[CONV:NATSPEC]`/`[CONV:BLANKLINES]`/`[CONV:NAMING]` satisfied; avoid interface/storage changes unless requested.
- **Testing**: After Solidity changes → `forge test` (or note suites remaining); after TS → lint/tests with Bun; after Bash → check execution flags/sourcing. State explicitly if anything not run.
- **Summary format**: Start with applied rules (filename/anchor), include tests/lints run, call out follow-ups/gaps.
- **Context continuity**: If context refreshed mid-task, restate active requirements/rules; warn when approaching limits (see `00-context-monitor.mdc`).
