- Ensure conventions ([CONV:LICENSE]/[CONV:NATSPEC]/[CONV:BLANKLINES]/[CONV:NAMING]) are satisfied before handing off; avoid interface/storage layout changes unless requested.
- After Solidity changes run relevant `forge test` (or note exact suites remaining); after TS changes run lint/tests with Bun; after Bash changes sanity-check execution flags and helper sourcing. If anything not run, state it explicitly.
- Summaries should start with applied rules (by filename/anchor) and include which tests/lints ran; call out any follow-ups or remaining gaps clearly.
- If context was refreshed mid-task or earlier content may have been dropped, restate the key active requirements/rules so they remain in scope, and warn the user when approaching context limits.
