name: Solidity baseline
description: Baseline rules for all Solidity files (contracts, scripts, tests)
globs:
  - '**/*.sol'
  - '**/*.s.sol'
  - '**/*.t.sol'
---

## Licensing ([CONV:LICENSE])

- Our own files: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: LGPL-3.0-only` immediately followed by the pragma statement with no blank line in between.
- External copies retain original license + source note.
- All contracts must use `pragma solidity ^0.8.17;`.
- Do not mirror legacy `Unlicense` headers from older test utilities when creating new `.sol` files; new Solidity files in this repo must follow the LGPL+pragma convention above.

## Naming Conventions ([CONV:NAMING])

- Functions/vars camelCase; constants & immutables are CONSTANT_CASE.
- Function params use leading underscore (e.g., `_amount`).

## NatSpec Requirements ([CONV:NATSPEC])

- Contracts & interfaces must include:
  - `@title` - must match the contract/interface name (same as filename without `.sol`)
  - `@author LI.FI (https://li.fi)`
  - `@notice` - must describe what the contract/interface contains and its purpose
  - `@custom:version X.Y.Z`
- Public/external functions require NatSpec including params/returns.
- For pure test/script scaffolding keep headers minimal but retain SPDX/pragma.

## Blank Lines ([CONV:BLANKLINES])

- Single blank line between logical sections and between function declarations.
- Follow in-function blank-line rules (before emits/returns; no stray gaps).
- Blank line between `vm.expectRevert()` and function call in tests.
- Blank line before `vm.stopPrank()` if separate logical block.
- Blank line before assertions.
- Single blank line between test cases.
- Single blank line after `vm.startPrank(address)`.
- For `vm.expectEmit` blocks: no blank line between `vm.expectEmit` and its event definition, but blank lines before and after the entire block.
- Group related test assertions together without blank lines between them.

## Error Handling

- Use custom errors instead of revert strings; prefer existing errors/helpers before adding new ones.
- Use generic errors from `src/Errors/GenericErrors.sol`; bump `@custom:version` when adding; facet-specific errors stay local.

## Code Quality

- Adhere to rules in `.solhint.json`.
- Avoid assembly unless necessary and heavily commented with justification (why assembly is needed here); prefer existing helpers over new implementations.
