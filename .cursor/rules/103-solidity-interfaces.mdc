## Interface File Requirements

- **Production interfaces** (used in `src/`) must be Solidity `.sol` files located in `src/Interfaces/`; do not place production interfaces elsewhere.
- **Test interfaces**: Test files may define inline interfaces as needed for testing purposes.
- **Separation**: Do not mix interface and implementation in the same file.

## Naming Conventions

- Interfaces must start with `I*` prefix (e.g., `IStargate`, `IEcoPortal`).
- Parameter naming: follow [CONV:NAMING]; use descriptive, lowerCamelCase names that match the upstream protocol where practical, but prefer local clarity over blindly mirroring odd upstream names.
- Upstream references: when copying from or shadowing an external protocol, add a short NatSpec note with a link or identifier that references the original contract or documentation.
- Scope: only include the structs/events/functions that are actually used by our code; avoid copying the entire upstream interface surface if it is not needed.
