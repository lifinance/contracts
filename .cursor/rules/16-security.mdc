- Treat security guidance in `conventions.md` (“Security and Governance”, “Facet Contract Requirements”, and “Solidity Standards → Error Handling”) as authoritative before changing validation, access control, or error patterns.
- Validate all external inputs and configuration (including script/env values) explicitly; prefer existing validation helpers (e.g., `Validatable`, config readers) over ad-hoc checks.
- Do not weaken existing access controls, timelock flows, or Safe multisig protections; any change that touches admin-only functionality must call out its governance impact.
- Prefer custom errors over revert strings for new code and reuse generic errors from `src/Errors/GenericErrors.sol` where applicable.
- Avoid introducing new external call patterns in facets or scripts without checking existing libraries (`LibAsset`, `LibSwap`, `LibAllowList`) and related docs under `docs/` for prior art.
