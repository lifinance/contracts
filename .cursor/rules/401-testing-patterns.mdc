## Testing Workflow

- Prefer adding or updating tests alongside logic changes.
- Keep tests structured as setup → execute → assert.
- Assert _specific_ failure conditions (avoid overly-broad "catch-all" assertions).
- After modifications, clearly state which test commands (Foundry/Bun) were (or were not) run.
