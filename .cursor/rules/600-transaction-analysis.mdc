## Activation Gate

**Apply ONLY when:**

- User provides tx hash + network name AND asks to analyze/debug that specific transaction
- Phrases like: "analyze this transaction", "debug this failing tx", "why did this bridge/swap revert?" (or similar variations)
- User invokes `/analyze-tx` command

**Do NOT apply for:**

- General Solidity/Foundry questions
- Deployment questions not tied to a single transaction
- High-level protocol/architecture questions
- Requests without concrete tx hash

If partially matched (e.g., hash but no network), ask for missing info before entering transaction-analysis mode.

## Transaction Analysis Mode

When activated, use `.cursor/commands/analyze-tx.mdc` for complete workflow, rules, and policies.
