     * Arguments for calling prepare()
     * @param invariantData The data for a crosschain transaction that will
     *                      not change between sending and receiving chains.
     *                      The hash of this data is used as the key to store
     *                      the inforamtion that does change between chains
     *                      (amount,expiry,preparedBlock) for verification
     * @param amount The amount of the transaction on this chain
     * @param expiry The block.timestamp when the transaction will no longer be
     *               fulfillable and is freely cancellable on this chain
     * @param encryptedCallData The calldata to be executed when the tx is
     *                          fulfilled. Used in the function to allow the user
     *                          to reconstruct the tx from events. Hash is stored
     *                          onchain to prevent shenanigans.
     * @param encodedBid The encoded bid that was accepted by the user for this
     *                   crosschain transfer. It is supplied as a param to the
     *                   function but is only used in event emission
     * @param bidSignature The signature of the bidder on the encoded bid for
     *                     this transaction. Only used within the function for
     *                     event emission. The validity of the bid and
     *                     bidSignature are enforced offchain
     * @param encodedMeta The meta for the function
