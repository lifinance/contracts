# LI.FI Project Rules for CodeRabbit

**IMPORTANT: This file is a pointer to dynamic rules. CodeRabbit should read and apply all rules from `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files.**

## Dynamic Rules Location

All project conventions and rules are defined in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files. These files are:
- **Dynamic**: Updated frequently as new rules are added
- **Organized**: Each file covers a specific domain (Solidity, TypeScript, Architecture, etc.)
- **Tracked**: All files are version-controlled in git

## Rule Files to Apply

CodeRabbit should read and apply ALL rules from the following directory:
- `.cursor/rules/` - Contains all rule files (*.mdc)

All rule files (24 total):
- `.cursor/rules/000-global-standards.mdc` - Global guardrails, anti-hallucination, context hygiene
- `.cursor/rules/001-project-structure.mdc` - Directory structure, file organization, and where to place new files
- `.cursor/rules/002-architecture.mdc` - Core architectural principles for Diamond, separation of concerns, and governance

## Instructions for CodeRabbit

1. **Read all `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files** - These contain the actual rules and conventions
2. **Apply rules based on file globs** - Each rule file specifies which files it applies to (via `globs` in frontmatter)
