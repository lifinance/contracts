# TODO
# - implement all deploy use cases
#   - use case 4 is still missing
# - improve logging (use external library for console logging)
# - add verify contract use case (use bytecode and settings from storage)

# - clean code
#   - local before variables
#   - variable names uppercase
#   - make environment / file suffix global variables
#   - add function descriptions in helper functions

# - update docs / notion
#   - add info about SALT env variable to deploy new contracts
# - write article
# - for immutable diamond we need to run some specific script - add to deploy script
# - improve the handling of several similar log file entries
# - add fancy stuff
#   - show deployer wallet balance before/after
#   - script runtime
# - offer to exclude bytecode verification and adapt ensureENV for networks for which we dont have a functioning block explorer

# known limitations:
#   - we currently cannot replace any of the core facets with our scripts
#   - log can contain several entries of the same contract in same version - need to define which of those to return
