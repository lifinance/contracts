# LI.FI Smart Contract Conventions

# Repository Overview

- **Project name:** LI.FI
- **Purpose:** LI.FI is a cross-chain bridge aggregation protocol that ensures secure and efficient interoperability through robust smart contracts and automated processes.
- **Core components:**
  - **Smart contracts:** Primarily built using the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) with modular facets for core functionality, along with supporting periphery contracts for extended features and integrations.
  - **Deployment Framework:** Shell/bash scripts that provide a robust deployment framework with automated retry mechanisms for handling RPC issues and other deployment challenges. These scripts wrap Foundry's deployment functionality to add reliability and automation.
  - **Automation scripts:** Deployment, updating, and operational tasks.
  - **Tests:** Tests ensuring contract reliability and safety.
  - **Documentation:** Detailed guides, API specifications, and deployment instructions.

# Architectural Principles

## Diamond Standard (EIP-2535)

The Diamond Standard is the core architectural pattern used in this project. It provides:

- Modular contract architecture through facets
- Upgradeable contracts without proxy storage collision issues
- Ability to add, replace, and remove functionality
- Efficient contract size management
- Clear separation of concerns

## Development Framework

We use Foundry as our primary development and testing framework. Foundry provides:

- Fast and efficient testing
- Built-in fuzzing capabilities
- Gas optimization tools
- Deployment scripts
- Contract verification

## Security and Governance

- Production contracts are owned by Safe multisig contracts
- Changes require multiple signatures
- Moving towards Timelock-based governance:
  1. Propose change to multisig
  2. Collect required signatures
  3. Execute call to Timelock
  4. After minDelay period, anyone can execute the change

## Smart Contract Conventions

### Solidity Standards

- **Version Management:**

  - All Solidity files must start with license identifier, followed by a blank line, then pragma statement
  - The EVM and Solidity version used for deployments (unless networks require lower versions) is defined in `foundry.toml`

- **License requirements:**
  All our own Solidity files must use the LGPL-3.0 license identifier. This applies to:

  - All contracts in `src/` directory (except external dependencies)
  - All test files in `test/solidity/` directory
  - All deployment and task scripts in `script/` directory

  License identifier format:

  ```solidity
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: LGPL-3.0-only
  ```

  Exceptions:

  - External dependencies (libraries, etc.)
  - External contracts copied from other projects: here we must retain the original license and add information from where we copied this contract

  Example for how to mark a contract that

  ```solidity
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  // Modified from: https://github.com/nomad-xyz/ExcessivelySafeCall
  // Original license: MIT OR Apache-2.0
  // Modifications © 2025 LI.FI
  pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
  ```

- **Design Patterns:**
  - Use established patterns (e.g., Ownable for access control, EIP-2535 Diamond Standard)
  - Favor modular design for reusability and security
  - Follow security best practices:
    - Validate constructor inputs rigorously
    - Use reentrancy guards
    - Optimize for gas efficiency

- **Error Handling:**
  - All custom errors must be defined in `src/Errors/GenericErrors.sol`
  - Error names should be descriptive and follow PascalCase
  - Errors should not include error messages (gas optimization)
  - Use custom error types rather than generic `revert()` statements

- **Interface Design Standards:**
  - All interfaces must start with `I` prefix (e.g., `ILiFi`, `IStargate`)
  - Use consistent parameter naming across similar interfaces
  - All interfaces must be placed in separate files in the `src/Interfaces` directory
  - Do not define interfaces in the same file as their implementation

## Code Style and Documentation

### General Rules

1. **Extensive Documentation**

   - All code should be thoroughly documented
   - Comments should explain the "why" not just the "what"
   - Complex logic must be documented with clear explanations
   - Usage of Assembly must be justified and Assembly blocks must be extensively commented

2. **Blank Line Rules**

   - **Between Sections:**

     - Single blank line between logical sections (state variables, events, constructor, functions)
     - Single blank line between function declarations
     - No blank lines between function signature and body

   - **Inside Functions:**

     - Single blank line before new logical blocks (loops, conditions, function calls)
     - Single blank line after setting up state variables
     - Single blank line before emitting events
     - No blank lines between `if` statements and their `revert()` calls
     - Single blank line before `return` statements

   - **Between Declarations:**

     - Single blank line between structs and enums
     - Single blank line between mappings and other declarations
     - No blank line between related consecutive mappings
     - Single blank line between modifiers
     - No blank line between events and errors

   - **Test Files (.t.sol):**
     - Blank line between `vm.expectRevert()` and function call
     - Blank line before `vm.stopPrank()` if separate logical block
     - Blank line before assertions
     - Single blank line between test cases
     - Single blank line after `vm.startPrank(address)`
     - For `vm.expectEmit` blocks: no blank line between `vm.expectEmit` and its event definition, but blank lines before and after the entire block
     - Group related test assertions together without blank lines between them

### Documentation Requirements

1. **Contract NatSpec Documentation**

   - Every contract MUST have the following NatSpec tags in this order:
     ```solidity
     /// @title ContractName
     /// @author LI.FI (https://li.fi)
     /// @notice Brief description of the contract's purpose
     /// @custom:version X.Y.Z
     ```
   - The @author tag MUST always be "LI.FI (https://li.fi)"
   - The @custom:version MUST follow semantic versioning (X.Y.Z format)
   - Additional NatSpec tags (like @dev, @custom:security, etc.) may be added after these required tags

2. **Interface NatSpec Documentation**

   - Every interface MUST have the following NatSpec tags in this order:
     ```solidity
     /// @title InterfaceName
     /// @notice Brief description of the interface
     /// @author LI.FI (https://li.fi)
     /// @custom:version X.Y.Z
     ```
   - The @custom:version MUST follow semantic versioning (X.Y.Z format)
   - For external interfaces that we're wrapping, original authorship should be preserved if applicable

3. **Function Documentation**

   - Every public/external function must have NatSpec comments
   - Include description of what the function does
   - Document parameters and return values
   - Note if function is restricted to admin or specific addresses
   - Example:
     ```solidity
     /// @notice Brief description of function purpose
     /// @param parameterName Description of parameter
     /// @return Description of return value
     /// @dev Additional details about implementation (optional)
     ```

4. **Complex Logic Documentation**
   - Add inline comments for complex algorithms
   - Explain non-obvious optimizations
   - Document gas-saving techniques
   - Clarify mathematical operations

### Facet Contract Requirements

### Location and Naming

- Must reside in `src/Facets/`
- Names must include "Facet"

### Required Functions

1. `_startBridge` (internal)
2. `swapAndStartBridgeTokensVia{FacetName}`
3. `startBridgeTokensVia{FacetName}`

### Inheritance Structure

- **Interfaces:**
  - `ILiFi` - Standard interface for bridging operations
- **Libraries:**
  - `LibAsset` - Asset handling
  - `LibSwap` - Swap utilities
  - `LibAllowList` - Contract call approval
- **Security:**
  - `ReentrancyGuard` - Reentrancy protection
  - `SwapperV2` - Swap functionality
  - `Validatable` - Bridge data validation
- **External:**
  - `ECDSA` - Signature verification (optional)

### Parameter Handling

- **Sender/Refund Address:**

  - Avoid using `msg.sender` for as refundAddress, use a dedicated parameter instead

- **Parameter Ordering:**
  - `receiverAddress` should be first in `{facetName}Data` struct
  - Must validate against `bridgeData.receiver`
  - Verify `targetChainId` against `bridgeData.destinationChain` for EVM-to-EVM

### Required Modifiers

- `nonReentrant` - Prevents reentrancy
- `refundExcessNative` - Handles excess native tokens
- `validateBridgeData` - Validates bridge parameters
- `doesNotContainSourceSwaps` / `doesContainSourceSwaps`
- `doesNotContainDestinationCalls` / `doesContainDestinationCalls`

### Events

1. **Transaction Start:**

   - Event: `LiFiTransferStarted`
   - Emit: At transaction start, before external calls
   - Purpose: Track bridge transactions
   - Usage: ONLY to be used in Facet contracts

2. **Transaction Completion:**

   - Event: `LiFiTransferCompleted`
   - Emit: After successful execution
   - Purpose: Signal transaction finalization
   - Usage: ONLY to be used in the Executor contract, NOT in Facet contracts

3. **Transaction Recovery:**

   - Event: `LiFiTransferRecovered`
   - Emit: When transaction is recovered
   - Purpose: Track recovery attempts
   - Usage: ONLY to be used in Receiver contracts (e.g., ReceiverAcrossV3, ReceiverChainflip, ReceiverStargateV2), NOT in Facet contracts

4. **Same-chain Swap:**
   - Event: `GenericSwapCompleted`
   - Emit: After successful execution of same-chain swap
   - Purpose: Track completion of same-chain swap operations

### Fee Handling

- For native fees, use the `_depositAndSwap` variant
- Reserve required fee before execution

### Non-EVM Chain Support

- Use `bytes` (not `bytes32`) for `receiverAddress`
- Validate non-EVM address is not zero:
  ```solidity
  if ({facetName}Data.receiverAddress == bytes(0)) {
      revert InvalidNonEVMReceiver(
          {facetName}Data.receiverAddress,
          bytes(0)
      );
  }
  ```
- Use `LibAsset.NON_EVM_ADDRESS` for `bridgeData.receiver`:
  ```solidity
  if (bridgeData.receiver != LibAsset.NON_EVM_ADDRESS) {
      revert InvalidCallData();
  }
  ```

## Solidity Test Conventions (.t.sol files)

### File Naming and Structure

- Test files must have a `.t.sol` extension
- Group and order imports with system libraries first and project files next

### Test Function Naming

- All tests that verify a successful execution must be prefixed with: `test_`
- All tests that verify a failure case must be prefixed with: `testRevert_`
- All negative tests must check for a specific revert reason
- For base or inherited tests, prefix with `testBase_`

### Test Structure and Setup

- Every test contract must include a `setUp()` function
- The `setUp()` function must:
  - Configure custom block numbers
  - Initialize base contracts
  - Set up facets
  - Assign labels using `vm.label`
- Any contract inheriting from `TestBase.sol` must call `initTestBase()` in `setUp()`
- Use `vm.startPrank(address)` and `vm.stopPrank()` for user simulation

### Assertions and Event Testing

- Use `assertEq()` for checking equality of values
- Use custom assertion modifiers for balance changes
- Use `vm.expectRevert()` to verify specific revert reasons in failure test cases. Simply checking the success/failure status of a call() is not sufficient.
- Use `vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true, <contractAddress>)` for event testing
- Verify expected events are emitted with correct parameters

### Test Best Practices

- Include comments to explain test purpose
- Maintain consistent order in function calls and assertions
- Structure tests: setup → execute → assert

## Solidity Linter (solhint) Configuration

All Solidity files must follow the rules defined in `.solhint.json`. This configuration enforces our coding standards for gas optimization, security, and code style.

## Script Conventions

### TypeScript Scripts

- All scripts must follow the rules defined in `.eslintrc.cjs`
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

- Include proper type definitions
- All scripts must use `citty` for CLI argument parsing
- Use `consola` for consistent logging across scripts
- Environment variables should be validated using `getEnvVar()` helper
- Scripts should exit with appropriate exit codes (0 for success, 1 for error)

- **Execution Environment:**
  - All scripts should use `bunx tsx` for TypeScript execution
